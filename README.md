# 12-24HourClockC
Program written in C++ that displays both a 12 and 24 hour clock that a user can manipulate via a display menu. I made a terminal GUI that is both functional and user friendly. I could enhance the code by seperating some methods into different classes. That should speed up the program and provide better readability. The most challenging part of this program was converting the 12 hour clock into 24, and implementing the if statement that reverts the time back down to "1" if the time goes over "24". This project, while basic, gave me the ability to debug a program and find outside the box solutions that resulted in a fully functioning program. This project isn't only readable, but ale to be adapted by added more on the display menu and terminal gui to better support more functions that the user would want to carry out.
